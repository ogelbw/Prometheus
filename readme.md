This is my third year undergrad project, The goal of this project is to make a framework that allows LLMs to carry out generic tasks by having them create a plan and create their own python tools in order to achieve that plan. 

This repository is currently work in progress and is likely out of date until code freeze, until then feel free to look at the code but don't expect it to run.
